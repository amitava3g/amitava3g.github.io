        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Our common friend Subhodip visited our house last weekend for a dinner. He is a real foodie and have a very good knowledge about food and restaurants. So, I wanted to make something new on chicken for him and also for my blog. I have already posted 'mutton dopyaza' recipe, then I thought this time why not with chicken? Confirmed the idea with my hubby and 'chicken dopyaza' got selected for main-course along with 'mishti pulao'. They both gave me very positive reaction after finishing the dinner .... yaay &#128515; ! The recipe won't give you any stress, you can easily make them for big gatherings. If you are the host, then it's the perfect dish. The gravy is rich and very flavorful with juicy chicken pieces. 'Dopyaza' means you have to use double amount of onion - I used onion paste and cubed onion. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a delicious, fuss free dinner.]]></shortDesc>

In those days I don't like to stand in front of the gas for long time, because in the meantime you can enjoy the rain by sitting beside the window. I think you guys have already guessed that I am talking about one pot meal - they are so easy to cook. One of the famous one pot meal in Bengal is 'khichuri' / khichdi. I have posted several recipes on khichdi but 'bhoger khichuri' is the basic one. You can make this simple khichdi on 'puja' / vrat days as they are onion and garlic free. Don't expect this dish to be very rich or spicy, but to be very ordinary with full of taste. ]]></shortDesc>

In Bengal, you will get to see so many varieties of preparation on fish in parties / weddings. Among them few dishes are strictly made for those parties, I mean you can't even find them in restaurants ... how strange ! One of my favourite indo-chinese dish is 'Chilli Fish' - which is always a rockstar of any party's menu and also you can get them in many Chinese restaurants of India. It tastes heavenly with hakka fried rice or noodles and it is very easy to make. Try this recipe in your kitchen and enjoy.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Most probably I am the only blogger who have taken so long to post about her own regional recipe of 'phuchka'. Because almost every blogger has their own regional recipe of 'panipuri / golgappa'. But it's better late than never. In Kolkata I never eat 'phuchka' with sweet chutney, always with tangy tamarind water &#128521; and believe me there is no fun of having them sweet, the taste has to be spicy and tangy. 'Phuchka' is nothing but hollow chips with spicy potato mixture in the center and then filled with tangy water. So, so, so good and tastes million bucks ! Every single description will be short in comparison to a plate of 'phuchka'. As I used store bought chips, so, I am sharing only the recipe of potato filling and tangy water. Try this any day in your kitchen and enjoy a great evening with your family.]]></shortDesc>

Only we know about the pain of making time-consuming breakfast. But these parathas are so simple and take very less time to cook. We both thoroughly enjoyed the spicy onion filling inside those soft parathas. You can make 5 parathas with these proportions and serve them with pickles, raita or veg / non veg curry. These parathas can also be served in lunch box. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a peaceful breakfast with your family.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Who doesn't crave for yummy snacks in the evening with some cold drinks during summer ?? I guess everybody does. Summer or winter doesn't matter ... weekend evenings are meant for some awesome starters ! After few trials I finally created the exact taste of Kolkata's one of the famous street food - 'kobiraji cutlet'. Kobiraji means coverage or lace like texture, which you can create with beaten egg. I know they are not at all healthy but they tastes insanely delicious. So, my advice - don't avoid them but eat once in three months &#128521;. I used minced mutton for this dish, you can also use minced chicken or fish fillets. Everytime you will fall in love with them after the first bite, believe me. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely evening with your loved ones.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Earlier I have shared the recipe of 'Kolhapuri Egg curry', today I am going to share the same recipe, but with chicken and some changes. One of the main ingredient in Maharashtrian cuisine is 'coconut'. We both are not too much coconut eater but when it comes to make authentic dish, I always try to make the taste as close as possible. As this is a 'Kolhapuri' gravy, you have to incorporate coconut. I didn't have fresh one that's why I used dried one. We both found the taste and flavour of the dish extremely delicious. The spicy gravy with sweet coconut flavour and juicy chicken pieces will take you to another world. Try this easy recipe in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely dinner with your family.]]></shortDesc>

The recipe is very similar to chicken manchurian (which I have already posted), except the key ingredient here is cauliflower, not chicken. You can make this dish with potatoes, soya granules or raw jackfruit also. Every single time it tastes delicious and goes best with fried rice or rumali roti. I made mine on dry side, but if you want this on gravy side, just add more water or vegetable stock. Both of them tastes incredible and you can serve them as starter or as maincourse also.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Though I ate various types of kabab in India but had no clue about 'chicken shawarma'. I tasted this delicious dish first time in Austin, Texas and now they are available in pretty much all over the world. Shawarma' is a middle eastern kabab preparation which can be made of lamb / chicken / turkey or beef. I had them first time with pilaf and second time with pita bread. My husband and I both fell in love with the second version and tried so many of them from different restaurants. Professionally 'shawarma' is made by stacking the seasoned meat on a spit and then roasted slowly in front of a flame for hours. At home we can't get that facility .. so don't worry, make them on tawa or flat pan and enjoy the same taste and texture of 'shawarma'.]]></shortDesc>

Just before entering we had our food around 11AM so that we are not hungry while enjoying the National Park. We will talk more about our journey and food in some upcoming blog. Yellowstone is mainly located in Wyoming but its partly located in Montana and Idaho as well. The West Gate is located in Montana. It is the first National Park in US with 2,219,791 acres of land. It has rivers, mountains and forests.</div><img src="recipeimages/nature-with-canon-c6228e74-1670-4c75-82b9-6402f4624e49.jpg" /><div>The most interesting part of Yellowstone is the hot spring and thrilling volcanic spots.

We went to the lower Antelope Canyon. They offer a guided tour. The tour guide was funny and full of plenty of information. Entering the canyon was a bit difficult (not that difficult, but old/aged people might find a bit difficult).

On special occasions or guest's arrival in evening, 'mangsher ghugni' is a very common item we Bengalis make. It's a Indian version of 'chili'.

        <process><![CDATA[<div><b>Journey Started on January 29, 2016</b><br/>We started our journey from Austin at 11:15AM by Mega Bus and reached to the destination at sharp 3PM. As it was winter, I wouldn't say that scenic view during road journey was good because most of the trees were leafless. Anyway, after reaching there we first went towards our hotel 'The Adolphus' and checked in there. The hotel was at downtown and interior was 80's. The decoration will give you a nice feeling and our room was pretty good. We got little tired after the journey, so, took rest for an hour.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-f5c253f9-1852-4116-a349-5ced86f63aee.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-42e876f5-91cd-4963-b505-fbfd6c8a04c3.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-cdc5f407-4675-40bc-bd73-a046d2031027.jpg" /><div><b><u>Attractions</u></b><br/></div><div><b>The Old Red Museum (01/29/2016)</b><br/>was our first stop after we got out from hotel and walked a little bit towards south on Commerce Street, it was 8 to 10 minutes of walk from our hotel. Old Red Museum or Dallas County Courthouse is also known as Old Red Courthouse. The building is made of red sandstone with marble accents. It is a historic government building. We loved the color and texture of the building. From the opposite side of the street, the view of this building was amazing. That was a busy street with little park and fountains.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ec7ea3b9-ff2a-437e-b47d-f22db997fd58.jpg" /><div><b>The Sixth Floor Museum at Deplay Plaza (01/29/2016)</b><br/> is our next destination which is few foot step away from Old Red Museum. This building is one of the historic landmark of Dallas and USA. The plaza was typically visited by tourists now-a-days. Since 1989 more than six million people visited this plaza. The building has its own significance because of president John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. The museum is located at 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository building.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-29acae94-60f9-4c7c-abf2-6704e07a09a5.jpg" /><div><b>Arboretum and Botanical Garden (01/30/2016)</b><br/>is a great place to start day two. We like nature and flowers so this place is the dream place for us. 66 acers of land with lot of flowers, trees and White Rock lake made this place a great tourist destination. We saw lot of families with their kids enjoying the sunny day. We started around 9:30AM from hotel and reached around 10AM, as the public transport is good so we thought of coming here by bus (#060), which takes about 30 minutes (took $5 for both of us). They charged $5 each for the entry fee. We spent around 2 hours in this place and took lot of photos of various kinds of winter flowers and obviously both me and my hubby posed for some awesome pics. We have seen lot of squirrels and captured their activities. We decided to have our lunch at downtown so took the same bus back to downtown.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-b1154edd-3c04-4d5b-819f-81130c9e1954.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-254d6894-300d-4a09-acde-42c010b5cab0.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-50360c4c-c8fd-40ed-a264-4ba4542b166c.jpg"  style='width:85%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-af0161de-a3c6-4adc-a4f9-ddc1a03c6026.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><div><b>Downtown Dallas (01/30/2016)</b><br/>has lot of exciting things to see, so we started with Thanks-Giving Square, it's a nice place and as usual we started clicking pics. Now time to walk towards the Dallas Museum of Art and just beside that the most happening place 'Klyde Warren Park' a place with food trucks but we just had our lunch so we couldn't enjoy the food. Lot of kids were playing in water as its a pretty hot day and we feel this place a little over crowded but a place to relax, sit and enjoy with family at the heart of downtown. We spent about an hour and now its time to head back to our hotel.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-87327f3a-37d4-4a8f-958e-4d83091dc3a8.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-4af722b8-6822-457b-92b8-e4a1ccea9cd8.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-f7f3454f-1ae9-4311-b036-f29bd876589c.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-64ec6d67-59a2-493d-a5b2-0cdb92b1bf19.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-e9822977-3804-467b-829a-fce9b52993e9.jpg" /><div><b><u>Time to Taste Food</u></b><br/></div><div><b>City Tavern (01/29/2016)</b><br/>was our first stop for dinner. It's basically a local bar and restaurant with downtown charm. The staff welcomed us and took order from us although it was a self-serviced restaurant. As we were not in mood of drinking, so we ordered Fish and Chips and Chicken Quesadilla with coke. They took 15-20 minutes to arrive. We are a big fan of 'fish and chips' and they served three fresh pieces of deep fried beer-battered cod fillets over loads of uniquely crunchy french fries with mayonnaise and mint sauce. In Austin almost every restaurant serves 'chicken quesadilla' and we tasted them so many times. In 'City Tavern' they grilled the tortillas with stuffing like cooked chicken, vegetables and cheese then served them with salsa sauce and sour cream. I love their taste and also impressed about it's quantity as I ordered from appetizer section. Overall, we were impressed by the polite, friendly nature of the staff and their food. The costs ($21) was pretty much reasonable as well.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ddcb0c1f-3a87-4959-8a16-14ce68abc67b.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-51b4a27f-fab3-4ca8-bb97-671ecf05e6a6.jpg" /><div><b>Press Box Grill (01/30/2016)</b><br/>our lunch stop after botanical garden. The restaurant was in a busy street, filled with people. But the staffs were very manageable and friendly. We ordered 'Blackened Salmon with rice and grilled veggies' and 'Buffalo chicken Burger' with coke. They served the food within 25 minutes. In the first dish, a medium size fresh salmon patty, some vegetables were grilled and paired with flavorful rice. Well, in the burger boneless chicken was sautéed with spicy buffalo sauce, topped with blue cheese and came with lots of crunchy fries. We enjoyed the food and ambience. Though we were pretty full, but couldn't resist ourselves from having 'Tiramisu Torte' as dessert. Oh boy, the cake was layered, creamy, soft, and less sweet, perfect for us. We left the place after having $48 lunch and with satisfied heart and smiley face.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-72146840-8451-49d8-bdbb-704ece5b5401.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-a9109dc8-6d92-434a-b373-fb1249060684.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ed786ab2-6c52-448a-9c9f-5d7255d9254d.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-ab29ab01-2d25-4461-8eb6-120f31419958.jpg" /><div><b>Wing Bucket (01/30/2016)</b><br/>was on the route towards 'old red museum'. I eyed that restaurant from the first day and went there on last day for dinner. Outside as well as inside were fully crowded with loads of wings on each table. After seeing them, we also felt greedy and placed order for 'chicken wings' in 'honey chipotle and margarita chile' sauce and 'fried chicken sandwich' with fries and coke. They offer 19 levels of spice for the chicken wings, can you imagine!!! After 15 minutes the food was served. We started tasting wings, well first 5 minutes were decent, but after that our hands became totally messy with tasty sauces. Then, we noticed it was not only we, every people in that restaurant was in the same condition!! Our sandwich was filled with crispy and saucy boneless chicken strips and was paired with french fries which was dusted with chili powder and salt. We loved each and everything from our $30 order and felt lucky that we didn't miss this one particularly among all others.</div><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-3d5d76be-974f-4fd3-b15c-592defe44b3c.jpg"  style='width:45%'/><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-973c114d-eeef-4fc2-9394-e23199a9600c.jpg" /><img src="recipeimages/dallas-trip-5aa87bd3-cf94-4ca7-848d-65222f31e3b7.jpg" /><div>Its the last day or our trip, so we packed everything and checked out from the hotel around 9AM.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I am a homemaker and a food blogger. Both my husband and me love to eat different food as well as travel various US cities. I was planning to share our travel and food experience with you.
Presently we are staying at Austin and our last trip was to California on June, 2015. You can think of how much bore we were for not going outside Austin for past 7 months. We celebrated 'Durga Puja', 'Christmas', 'New Year' in Austin but something was missing!!! So, I took the initiative and planned a very short trip to the nearest city, Dallas. We both wanted some relaxation and refreshment. Did we get that in Dallas?? WoW, yeaahhh... 
We visited the historic Texas city with lot of cultural heritages and true history of the state. Today I am sharing our experience of Dallas with you. As this is my first travel blog so please let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Every place in this world has their own tea stalls and also some unique dishes. You can never match the taste of tea stall's food with big restaurant's food ... a huge difference !  One of the famous item of those stalls in India is 'toast'. You can get so many types of toast from them like 'butter toast', 'french toast', 'plain toast' etc. I love to eat 'dim pauruti' or in fancy words 'savory french toast' as snack with some ketchup. I used to take these toasts in my lunch box also. They are delicious and very easy to make. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy.]]></shortDesc>

Well, it's bengali style 'chanar kalia' where plain curdled milk / cheese balls are first deep  fried and then cooked in a tomato based gravy. It's a vegetarian delicacy of Bengali cuisine. The dish tastes awesome and goes best with plain basmati rice. In any puja or special occasion, we make this dish and it always becomes the attraction of the entire menu. I made this dish yesterday on lunch for the first time in my life and I pretty much nailed it. Try this easy recipe in your kitchen and enjoy with your family.]]></shortDesc>

They are so sweet and juicy, also very good for our health. Afternoons are so hot these days, almost every day I make smoothie with different type of fruits. Last week I made this 'papaya smoothie' and we loved it. It not only makes you cool but also works magically  for disturbed stomach.

One of my favourite among them is 'maongo mousse'. Mousse has very light and fluffy texture that's why I love to eat it. Sometimes, to me, after having heavy meals rich dessert becomes overpowering, in those case 'mousse' is very good option. I made my mousse with mango puree and without egg, gelatin.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Bengalis love fish. We can eat fish in many forms like thick curry (kaliya), thin curry (jhol), batter fried, shallow fried (mach vaja), steamed version (vapa) and so on. One of the popular among them is 'fried fish'. Now in this category also we have so many variations. The most simple one is shallow fried marinated (with salt and turmeric) fish and the complicated one is 'Fish Roll'. In this recipe we stuff the marinated fish fillet with crumbly fish stuffing, then roll the fillet, coat with breadcrumbs and then deep fry them ... it's the example of our ultimate love towards fish &#128522;&#128522; . The hard part is making the roll, except that step, everything is easy. The taste of fish roll is phenomenal. You just need to give one bite to understand it's deliciousness. ]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Don't know about you, but I love 'keema' / mince form of meat. I have already posted so many recipes on 'keema' and this time I made paratha with mince chicken. The authentic recipe calls for 'mutton keema' but didn't have it that time, so made it with chicken and the parathas came out perfectly fine. These breads can be enjoyed with pickle, raita or any type of gravy. The recipe is very simple but you need to mince the chicken very fine like paste, otherwise paratha will not come out perfect. Try this recipe in your kitchen and let me know how it turned out.]]></shortDesc>

Summer is almost here and I have already started to make different types of drinks and smoothies. Among them, one of my favourite is 'chaas'.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[The name sounds odd ? Well, I am not crazy, we call this mutton curry vegetarian because it has no onion and garlic. The food we usually offer to our god / godess is called 'bhog' which never contains onion and garlic. During 'kalipuja' or diwali, we Bengalis make this vegetarian mutton curry with the meat of 'pathaboli' (ritual). The taste of this curry is suprisingly delicious, even if there is no onion and garlic. It's a very authentic Bengali lunch main course item which you can serve with steamed rice. The recipe is very easy but the taste is unbeatable.]]></shortDesc>

Last day I was in no mood of making any typical fried snacks, then making soup appears to be the easiest one. From morning the day was cloudy, so I wanted to eat something spicy. I picked hot and sour soup from the list, it's healthy and also spicy. I have added chicken, egg and lots of vegetables in the soup, it turned out super delicious.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[This is a very typical Bengali veg dish which you can only enjoy with steamed rice. We, bongs, have a very strong connection with 'posto' / poppy seeds and 'shorshe' or mustard seeds. We can creat so many delicious items with these two simple things. Now, 'he' is not a fan of eggplant, except fried version, to feed him this particular vegetable is really painful. I always have to make special dishes with eggplant, otherwise I end up eating all the eggplant and he finishes up rest of the curry, horrible ! So, last week I made this 'begun basonti' and do you know what happened ? He didn't make any fuss and finished up everything with a smile ... yaayy ! The taste of this eggplant gravy came out really good and I will make it again.

'Bhuna' means koshano / in low flame you have to cook something with spices for long time. The curry is very aromatic itself and goes very well with some steamed rice or naan.

I've already posted Kolkata style biriyani recipe which is much easier than Hyderabadi style as you need to have full confidence on timing and proportions. In Kolkata we make the chicken with gravy first and then give 'dum' with cooked rice, whereas, in this case you have to spread cooked rice over the marinated raw meat and then give it 'dum' until the meat becomes perfectly cooked and also remain juicy enough - it's not easy as it sounds. After several trials I have achieved my confidence on making this biriyani and it's my pleasure to share the recipe + details with you. ]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[We all love to eat fried stuff, right ? I know they are not that much healthy but still we do like them. I had lots of mushrooms in my fridge and couldn't find any interesting idea how to use them. Then suddenly I saw a picture of some beautifully golden colored veggie pops in google and I also remembered that I had cheese in my fridge. Then there was no confusion that I was going to make some cheese stuffed veggie pops. These pops can be enjoyed with ketchup by anybody, from kids to adults. Feel free to add any vegetable of your choice. After giving the first bite, those gooey melted cheese just blew my mind and thus, I had to share this yummy recipe with you. ]]></shortDesc>

I ate paneer in parties and very few times in restaurants. But after coming to US I learned how to make paneer at home and trust me, those self made soft white cubes gave me immense happiness. So, after that day we both have become paneer lover and have tried several dishes. This 'sahi paneer korma' is another rich mughlai dish from Indian cuisine. In this dish the lightly fried paneer is cooked in a creamy nut based gravy which tastes heavenly with plain chapati or naan or pulao. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy a lovely dinner with your loved ones.]]></shortDesc>

        <title>Mutton Rogan Josh (Pandit style)</title>
        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Mutton rogan josh is the signature dish of the Kashmiri cuisine which was bought by Mughals. 'Rogan' means oil / fat and 'josh' means intense heat. The dish is an aromatic mutton curry which is cooked in oil on high flame. Rogan josh can be prepared in two ways - one with onion and garlic, the other one is with yogurt and without onion, garlic. Kashmiri pandits cook this dish by following the second method. I also tried the 'no onion, no garlic' recipe and the taste came out phenomenal. The gravy may seems spicy but actually it is not. The authentic recipe calls for dry ginger powder, I didn't have that so I have used some grated ginger. Try this delicious mutton rogan josh in your kitchen and enjoy a good meal with your family.]]></shortDesc>

I will recommend you the second one for these stuffed tikkis as it enhances the taste of the entire dish. Now the ingredients of the stuffing are entirely up to you.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Chicken Bharta was prepared last weekend in our lunch. The recipe is punjabi inspired bengali dish. A very tasty shreded (pulled) chicken preparation that is famous throughout India. It has onion and tomato based gravy with beautiful flavour of kasuri methi and butter. In kolkata it's a frequently ordered dish in restaurants. To bring that exact flavour of resturant I have used 'tandoori masala', believe me, do not skip this masala because it will definitely give the taste a big uplift. Chicken bharta goes very well with any rice preparation or naan, kulcha. But pair it with some plain roti to enjoy it's authentic flavour.]]></shortDesc>

        <type>vegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I have seen two types of cauliflower's roast curry from childhood, my mom makes the yellow + spicy version and the other one is white + sweet version. Both of them are my favourite but today I am sharing the recipe of second version because I have already shared a similar as 1st one cauliflower curry in my earlier post. So, in Bengal this cauliflower white curry becomes very popular during festivals and goes best with pulao or plain roti. Few pure Bengali restaurants serve this dish during puja. The recipe is quite similar with them except some changes like they make this curry with pure 'ghee' but I made it with oil + little ghee etc. The taste came out phenomenal and 'he' finished half of the curry in one sitting. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy with your loved ones.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Rajasthan is a state of India which is situated at the western part. In childhood I went there with my family on vacation, though I remember nothing much except our album photos. Rajasthan is the land of kings and 'laal maas', means meat curry, is their well known dish. The dish is everything about colour and flavours. They cook the mutton in a yogurt based sauce with lots of chilies and smokey flavour. The authentic recipe calls for 'mathania chilli' because they creat very nice red colour with much less heat in gravy. Well, many of us don't have those chilies, so feel free to use kashmiri red chilies. Now, the recipe is very simple with loads of flavour, afterall it's a mutton curry, it has to be delicious !]]></shortDesc>

As a Bengali its my pleasure to share this recipe with you. *Note: you must take that special bhaat ghum otherwise you will feel incomplete.]]></shortDesc>

This cake has no egg, no butter and no milk. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy some guilt free chocolate cake with your family.]]></shortDesc>

To cook something special, what he loves, will be the perfect way to express my feelings to him on this perfect day. I researched a lot upon new ideas of biriyani, then my eyes got stuck on Chef Sanjay Thumma's 'ulta biriyani'- how beautiful it is!! I won't say that this is the authentic Arabian 'Maqlooba' because their cooking process and recipe are slightly different than ours. Anyway, I was searching for some new ideas and then found one. I was also impressed by its recipe, it's a one pot biriyani. You don't have to spend half of your day in kitchen making biriyani, the dish will take just an hour. This biriyani has soft, juicy chicken pieces, beautiful long grain rice and some mild flavours. Try this easy peasy upside down Chicken Biriyani in your kitchen and enjoy a perfect dinner with your (biriyani loving) partner ]]>&#x1f609;&#x1f609;<![CDATA[ ...

So, is there any doubt about what I'm talking about ?? Obviously about 'fulkopir pokora' or 'gobi pakore' !! One of our favorite weekday's meal is 'rice', 'veg daal' and these fritters. Generally in two ways you can make these fritters, one - you have to boil the florets before frying and two- you can stir fry them before deep frying like we Bengalis do. Believe me, the taste becomes delicious. You can enjoy your lunch more with these crunchy fritters.]]></shortDesc>

I also mentioned it as 'sish kebab' because in several places I found the same recipe but with this name. Serve them always with mint sauce or tzatziki sauce.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Its winter, the season of colourful veggies... One of my favourite veggie is 'green peas' / Koraishuti. You can make so many items with these tiny green balls like, 'matar paneer', 'peas kachori', 'dum aloo with peas', 'khichdi', 'veg daal', 'cabbage curry with peas' etc. But 'fish curry with green peas paste' may seems new to somebody. Its nothing but a dry fish curry with a tasty extra addition of green peas paste - as simple as that. When I was in school, on 1 of my birthday, mom made this special fish curry for me. That was the first and also last time I ate this dish, but still can remember the unique taste. So, two days before I thought to make something new with fish, suddenly remembered about this one. Immediately I gave a call to mom and asked for the recipe. She told me, I followed every line of her and Taaddaaa... a spicy+sweet+tangy fish curry came out from my kitchen. Please let me know how it turns out for you.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[We, nonvegetarian people, generally ordered nonveg dishes while eating at restaurants or dhabas. But we also love to eat home cooked vegetarian meals. In one of our trip to Digha before marriage, we made a stop at the famous 'Sher-e-punjab' for heavy breakfast. We ate there several times before but never did breakfast, so, that was our first time. As it was morning, we orderd veg like 'aloo paratha', 'aloo gobi', 'roti', 'bhindi masala' and 'lassi'. All of them were delicious but I will never forget the taste of 'aloo gobi'. Oh my god, my mouth is full of water right now !! It was the tasty, spicy and chatpata veg curry I have ever had. Bengalis usually make 'aloo-fulkopi' as a thick runny curry but that was a dry curry and goes best with roti and some salads. You can also give this yummy curry in lunchbox with bread. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.]]></shortDesc>

They served middle eastern food like 'falafel rice', 'hummus', 'shawarma platter' etc. We took a rice bowl with falafel. They served a good amount of flavourful saffron rice, fresh spinach, some good falafel, tasty hummus and tzatziki sauce. We really loved everything in that bowl. But the sauce caught my main attention. It was so fresh, the flavours were unique and added a different taste to the whole bowl. So, after coming home, I started to do research about this 'tzatziki' sauce and I never thought that the ingredients will be so simple. I made this sauce next day with some turkish kebabs and we enjoyed every bite of them. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.]]></shortDesc>

        <add-title>Mutton curry with ginger and green chilies</add-title>
        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Few days before I saw a fantastic picture of mutton curry in facebook. The caption was 'adabata aar kacha lonka diye mutton'. After seeing that picture, I decided to make it on dinner with some steamed rice. As the picture didn't provide the detailed recipe, except ginger and green chilies, I followed my own instinct while making the curry. After finishing, I got a thin, flavorful, tasty gravy and soft, succulent mutton pieces. The fresh flavour of green chilies makes the curry more scrumptious. The recipe is very simple and takes very less time to cook. Try this in your kitchen and let me know how it turns out.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Whenever food has smoked or grilled flavour, there is no second thought about it. Because it has to be tasty. There are so many colorful vegetables available in grocery market during winter. I told you before that my love for winter is only because of food. We can make and also consume without any tension various types of food. Today I am talking about 'eggplant'. Though we both are not big fan of eggplant, but love it in 2/3 forms- 'begun vaja', 'begun pora' and 'begun vorta'. Yess, the recipe is about the last one. 'Baingan bharta' is a very popular dhaba food in India. A simple veggie with loads of flavour will make your dinner a special one. If you can make this bharta properly, the taste will beat any nonveg dish. Just close your eyes and give it a try.]]></shortDesc>

My mom used to give me pure bengali style 'aloor porota' in my lunch box during school life and my friends were always a fan of my lunch box. That was my first story of this porota. When I was in college, we (my family) loved to eat 'dhaba food' during travel. In India, each and every dhaba serve 'aloo ka paratha'. I tasted their paratha many times and they were delicious. The taste was different from my mom's porota. This was the second story. The last one is from my dearest friend Monica. When I was in Jersy, one of my punjabi friend Monica, was an expert in making 'aloo ka paratha'. She literally taught me how to make them. Her paratha tastes heavenly. So, these paratha stories are parts of my life. As my husband doesn't like wheat paratha / atta paratha, I had to make them with flour / maida.

But when they served two cakes in a plate, the platter really impressed me. The taste was phenomenal and most important they didn't scare me at all. After that dinner I tried it in many other restaurants also and fell in love with crab meat (not whole crab). Last weekend I made these cakes at home and they came out delicious.

It become the most popular indian dish among the world. Biriyani has its own aroma, juicy meat and long grain flavourful rice. But in Kolkata they add boiled potato and egg in their biriyani which makes you more greedy:-) I know that the process is lenthy but believe me you will fall in love with the end result.]]></shortDesc>

With tortilla you can make 'taco', 'burrito', 'quesedilla', 'enchilada' etc. I really love each of them and that's why I want to make tortilla in my own kitchen. Usually they use vegetable lard for the dough, as I didn't have that in my home, I used lots of vegetable oil. You can use olive oil also. So, here is how I made my tortillas ...]]></shortDesc>

This time I made 'khara masala mutton', the taste was heavenly. After finishing the meal, there were nothing but bones in our plate. 'Khara masala' / 'kata moshla' means whole spices. You don't need to add any ground spices / paste in this curry. I think, this is an Eid special dish in Bangladesh.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA['Kofta' is a very flexible food item, you can serve them as starter or you can soak them in gravy and serve as main course also. This was my very first attempt on 'kofta' and from the beginning I was a bit nervous because I often heard that while frying them, kofta has a chance to break.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA['Makhni' is a name of rich, smooth, creamy gravy which is very popular in India. You can make 'chicken makhni', 'paneer makhni', 'kofta curry' and many more dishes with this gravy. I personally love the methi flavour and creaminess about this gravy. We had it in dinner last night with soft butter naans. The combination was heavenly. You just have to try this.]]></shortDesc>

So, I had exactly 1 hour in my hand to make something. Don't know why, but suddenly a thought of spending evening time in India, came in my mind.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Its true that I love eating pasta after coming usa. In India I was more fond of noodles, ramen or maggie. But recently I experimented couple of recipes on pasta and they turned out really well. I love my pasta on spicy side, that's why I mentioned it in the title. After baking with cheese, the taste of this dish became phenomenal. If you do not want to bake or use cheese, then make this dish without them. No worries, it also tastes delicious, believe me. You can say this dish is kind of one-pot-meal, usually don't need any sides. I love 'rotini' pasta, you can use 'penne', 'maccaroni', 'shells' or any kind of your choice. Try this in your kitchen and enjoy the meal with your family.]]></shortDesc>

Its been two years I am away from home (Kolkata). My papa used to buy me lots of crackers a day before diwali, we toast them in sunlight and in the evening of diwali my (maternal) uncle bought me some more crackers for his 'vagni'. Then around 8 pm me and my papa used to decorate our roof with candles and after that we started doing fireworks with our family. Ohh, I almost forgot to tell you about food. My mom used to make various types of sweets at home and we enjoyed them a lot. So, I made 'baked rosogolla' for this diwali, my first attempt and I nailed it.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[I love to eat mutton in any preparation, but do you have any experience of 'mutton kosha'? I would love to know your story. Because this dish is one of the traditional Bengali curries. We slow cook the mutton in its own juices with gravy and spices, thats why the end result always becomes finger licking good. You can serve 'mutton kosha' along with 'steamed rice', <a href='http://spicyworld.in/basonti-pulaao.html'>mishti pulaao</a>, 'luchi', 'porota' and 'plain roti'. Believe me every combo will make your lunch or dinner special everytime. Try this in your own kitchen and make your family haapy.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[When an inch of oil or ghee floats upon gravy, yes its 'mughlai nawabi dish'. 'Nawab' means king. This category of curries have nice colored, rich, thick, creamy gravy. 'Chicken Korma' is my favourite one. You can easily eat this curry once in a month along with 'biriyani', 'pulaao', 'butter naan' or 'rumali roti'. Do not put this kind of food in your regular diet because you have to make or eat korma without any guilt, otherwise you will never enjoy the richness of mughlai food.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[This dish dont need any explanation. Its very popular in India and nowadays all over the world. There was a rumor that without "tandoor/oven" you cannot make tandoori. But believe me today I am sharing "oven method and gas method" of making tandoori chicken. 'Tandoor' means oven made with clay and the heat comes from charcoal. In restaurants the actual tandoor flavour comes when juices of chicken drops on the charcoal, it creats a nice smokey flavour. You will fall in love with this dish. Please give it a try at your home and prove the rumor wrong.]]></shortDesc>

Last wednesday we both wanted to eat veg in dinner and I had an eggplant(begun) in my fridge. So, I googled for some spicy veg recipes made with eggplant, and my eyes got stuck to this one. The recipe is simple and very easy to make. I just made a little change, as 'he' doesn't like tamarind (tetul/imli) in his food, I had to use yogurt instead of it.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[In Kolkata we call this 'moglai porota (paratha)'. I made this with 'keema' or minced meat, that's why it is nonveg version. The process is a bit lenthy but it is worth trying. I made dry potato curry along with 'mughlai paratha' because these two goes very well with each other. I learned the recipe from my mother-in-law. She used to make this at evening without 'keema' and we all enjoyed those parathas very much. Here is the recipe with step by step clicks.

        <title>Macher Jhol</title>
        <type>nonVegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Bengalis make various kinds of fish curry with different types of fishes. The most simple and easy one is 'macher jhol' or fish curry. 'Jhol' means runny version of a curry. This dish is usually served as lunch with steamed rice and we all are fan of it. In 'macher jhol' you can use rohu / katla / tilapia / pomfret / pabda etc. One can add many kinds of vegetables like potato, cauliflower, eggplant, green peas, carrot etc. I always make this dish with potato and cauliflower because of 'him']]>&#x1f609;<![CDATA[. He typically loves this combo. According to me, there is only one restriction about this dish. You have to use 'green chilies' only for the heat and flavour. Try not to use red chili powder or dry red chili because it will make a huge difference. So, here is the recipe how I make 'macher jhol' for my family.]]></shortDesc>
        <ingrediants><![CDATA[<ul><li>4 fish pieces.</li><li>4 pieces of potato.</li><li>4-5 pieces of cauliflower.</li><li>½ onion thinly sliced.</li><li>½ tomato chopped.</li><li>1 Tablespoon nigella seeds (kalojeera).</li><li>5 green chilies.</li><li>2 Teaspoons turmeric powder.</li><li>½ Teaspoons roasted cumin powder.</li><li>Salt and sugar.</li><li>½ cup of mustard oil.</li><li>Warm water.</li></ul>]]></ingrediants>
        <process><![CDATA[<div>Wash the fish pieces very well and then marinate them with some salt and 1 Teaspoon turmeric powder for 15 minutes.</div><div>Heat oil in a kadai or pan. Fry the vegetables for 5 minutes in hot oil. Remove them in a plate.</div><div>Then add the marinated fish pieces one by one in hot oil.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-2.jpg" /><div>Fry both side of them for 5 minutes. Then remove it from the pan. You can also keep them on a paper towel, it will absorb the extra oil. While frying the vegetables do not make them dark in color.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-3.jpg" /><div>In the same hot oil add nigella seeds and 2 green chilies. Saute them. If you prefer to cook in less oil then remove some oil from the pan. But do not change the oil otherwise the taste will differ.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-4.jpg" /><div>After a minute add sliced onion and pinch of salt. Fry them for 4 minutes in medium flame. Do not make the onion dark in color.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-5.jpg" /><div>Then add chopped tomato, pinch of salt, 1 Teaspoon turmeric powder, 1 Teaspoon cumin powder and ½ Teaspoon sugar. Mix it very well in low flame for 5 minutes.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-6.jpg" /><div>When the oil starts separating add some warm water and 3 green chilies. Mix it well. If you like more heat, you can add more green chilies. Try to avoid red chili powder or dry red chili for this recipe only.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-7.jpg" /><div>After 2 minutes add the fried vegetables. Cook this for 8 minutes.</div><div>Then add the fried fish pieces. Mix gently with spatula and cook it for another 5 minutes.</div><div>Check the seasoning and if you want more curry add some warm water.</div><img src="recipeimages/macher-jhol-8.jpg" /><div>Turn off the heat and rest it for 5 minutes.</div>]]></process>

        <type>vegItem</type>
        <shortDesc><![CDATA[This recipe happened by mistake last week. I know what you are thinking!! But I will never regret about this mistake because it turned out delicious. Let me tell you the story first. Last week I took an attempt to make 'sondesh', but the taste came out very less sweeter. I got panicked and immediately called my only life saver 'mom'. She adviced me to follow the process of 'rosmalai'. In rosmalai we put 'rosogolla' in kheer and in my case, I put 'sondesh' in kheer. Magically it became a new, frequently demanded dessert to my family. 'Makhmali' means very soft in hindi. 'Sondesh' will become very soft after adding it in kheer, that's why I named it 'makhmali sondesh'.]]></shortDesc>

It will reduce the acidness.</li><li>Squeeze all the water from the chana. You can also put a weight on the chana for 30 minutes. The water will drain out.</li><li>Then take the chana in a plate and knead it with your palm for 5 minutes.</li><li>Add the sugar, milk powder and 1 Teaspoon ghee in the chana. Again knead it for 5 minutes. The texture will become smooth.</li><li>Greece a microwave proof bowl with 1 Teaspoon ghee.</li><li>Now place the chana in that bowl and spread it like a layer. </li><li>Put it in microwave for 3 minutes. After it comes down to room temperature let it rest for another 15 minutes in fridge. </li><li>Then cut it in small cubes and you will get your 'sondesh'.</li><li>For the kheer boil 4 cups of milk in a pan. Keep stirring the milk. When it will reduce to ½ add condensed milk. Mix it very well for 10 minutes.</li><li>Then add the heavy cream. Again mix it. When the kheer become thick add those sondesh into it. Cook this for another 4 minutes.</li><li>Turn off your heat and add vanilla essence.

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[Though me and my hubby both are nonveg lovers, but we also love spicy veg dishes. 'Kadai Paneer' is our favourite one. Last night my dinner was this paneer dish along with butter naan. There were no other words but 'delicious and mouth watering' about the combination. The main attraction here is KADAI masala. It gives such a nice flavour in this dish. Just close your eyes and go for it.]]></shortDesc>

        <shortDesc><![CDATA[We, Bengalis, call them 'beguni'. Some people call them 'baingan bhajji'. There is no difference among the names. This is all about the tastiness and chrunchiness. You can get this fritter with some puffed rice and green chili in Bengal from any 'choper dokan'/fast food centers. When they serve this in 'thonga'/paper bag, the feel and look always increase my apetite a bit. Make this at your home and enjoy the crunch with a cup of tea.]]></shortDesc>
